          <h2>6. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</h2>
          <p>
            <i>
              <b>In Short:</b>  We aim to protect your personal information
              through a system of organizational and technical security
              measures.
            </i>
            <br />
            <br />
            We have implemented appropriate technical and organizational
            security measures designed to protect the security of any personal
            information we process. However, please also remember that we cannot
            guarantee that the internet itself is 100% secure. Although we will
            do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of
            personal information to and from our Apps is at your own risk. You
            should only access the services within a secure environment.
            <br />
            <br />
          </p>

          <h2>7. DO WE COLLECT INFORMATION FROM MINORS?</h2>
          <p>
            <i>
              <b>In Short:</b>  We do not knowingly collect data from or market
              to children under 18 years of age.
            </i>
            <br />
            <br />
            We do not knowingly solicit data from or market to children under 18
            years of age. By using the Apps, you represent that you are at least
            18 or that you are the parent or guardian of such a minor and
            consent to such minor dependent’s use of the Apps. If we learn that
            personal information from users less than 18 years of age has been
            collected, we will deactivate the account and take reasonable
            measures to promptly delete such data from our records. If you
            become aware of any data we have collected from children under age
            18, please contact us at

          <h2>8. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?</h2>
          <p>
            <i>
              <b>In Short:</b>  In some regions, such as the European Economic
              Area, you have rights that allow you greater access to and control
              over your personal information. You may review, change, or
              terminate your account at any time.
            </i>
            <br />
            <br />
            In some regions (like the European Economic Area), you have certain
            rights under applicable data protection laws. These may include the
            right (i) to request access and obtain a copy of your personal
            information, (ii) to request rectification or erasure; (iii) to
            restrict the processing of your personal information; and (iv) if
            applicable, to data portability. In certain circumstances, you may
            also have the right to object to the processing of your personal
            information. To make such a request, please use the contact
            details provided below. We will consider and act upon any request in

            If we are relying on your consent to process your personal
            information, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any
            time. Please note however that this will not affect the lawfulness
            of the processing before its withdrawal.

            If you are resident in the European Economic Area and you believe we
            are unlawfully processing your personal information, you also have
